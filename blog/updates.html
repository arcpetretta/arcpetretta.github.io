    If you have been following me through phase 0 you will have noticed that I have made a lot of aesthetic improvements to the site this past week.  A lot of it was just toying around with CSS and making things a little prettier in general. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's funny because the difference between my sight from a visual standpoint is almost night and day.  Yet, changing backgrounds and editing the properties of different objects really isn't all that complicated.  If I looked at this sight 9 weeks ago I'd tell you there's no way I could make it despite it being pretty simple. It's amazing what dedication and practice will do even in short amounts of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was given one suggestion by a peer to make my "about me" and "resume" boxes closer together on the homepage. Personally, I liked them the way they were before but I went ahead and changed their orientation to please the masses (I'm a man of the people!). I'm not sure if moving things around makes that big of a difference.  However, as my site becomes more and more advanced it may eventually contribute to the overall user experience (UX).
  </p>
  <p>
    In any regard, I'm off to phase 1, people.  Wish me luck and hopefully I'll have time to continue making updates. Keep on keepin' on.
