<p>
The internet is something we use everyday with little thought. It's actually pretty astonishing if you think about it.  The internet dominates our lives in one way or another yet many of us know nothing about how it works.
</p>
<p>
At it's essence the internet is a wire. "It can't be that simple, can it?" Yes, it's that simple. Think about it... The way you get internet is probably via a wire of somesort whether it's normal copper wire or fiber-optic cable.  Maybe you get your's via satellite or cellphone network but for the most part we're all connected to the internet by the aformentioned means. 
</p>
<p>
On this wire we have servers connected to the internet. Servers are computers that hold information that can be accessed by those who have permission to do so.  Websites are housed on servers in the form of files. Almost everything you see on the internet is probably hosted (stored) on a server.
</p>
<p>
All computers and servers that are connected to the wire (internet) have unique IP (internet protocol) addresses that allow us to communicate with other computers. IP addresses are stored as a series of numbers but since that not so easy for us human beings to remember we usually assign a name to each server / computer (amazon.com, yahoo.com, espn.com, etc).
</p>
<p>
So is my PC connected to the internet? Well, kind of. Remember, servers are connected directly to the wire (internet). Those of us who are browsing the internet from a PC, Mac, etc are doing so through an ISP (internet service provider).  The ISP gives us access to the wire.  So yes, we are connected to the internet on our personal computers but that connection may or may not be as direct as you previously thought.
</p>
<p>
Let's say for the sake of argument that you get an email at work from someone in your family and you want to respond.  So you get on your work computer and send an email from joeshmoe@business.com to unclejohn@yahoo.com... Your email would travel from your computer along your ISP's wires outside through the mainwire (internet) to wherever your job hosts it's email server.  From your work's email server your email would travel back along the mainwire to yahoo.com's server. At this point the email is moved from through your uncle john's ISP wires where the email is finally delivered to his computer.
</p>
<p>
That's a lot of zigging and zagging. Now keep in mind that this happens many millions of times a day in the matter of seconds.  If that's not impressive I don't know what is.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, one more piece of internet hardware we haven't covered is the router.  This is the internet box that your ISP installs in your house for you.  These boxes are placed any place where there are multiple intersections on the internet (ex: your computer connected to the wire via your isp or a server connected to the wire). What routers do is they direct the information going in and out of your computer, server, etc. to the right place.  Seems like it's not so important but then remember how many people use the internet and the frequency in which we do it.  It's pretty impressive.
</p>
<p>
That pretty much covers the internet in a nutshell.  There's much more out there but this covers the essentials of how the internet works. Just a lot of computers and servers connnected directly (or indirectly) to a wire.
