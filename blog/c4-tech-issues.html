<div class = "blog-body">
<p> There are numerous issues in tech most of which are pretty well known to the general public.  There's the issue of diversity in our industry, cyber-security, etc. However, the fact that very few people talk about net-neutrality is wild. Our internet is at risk of changing for the worse and many people don't even know it.
</p>
<p>
Net-Neutrality is defined as: "the principle that internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites." In essence, net-neutrality is the idea that all data on the internet should be treated the same.
</p>
<p><a href= "https://youtu.be/fpbOEoRrHyU?t=1m54s"> If the concept still doesn't make sense to you this video can probably explain it better than I can.</a></p>
<p>
Before I move on, it's also worth noting that in a crazy turn of events Tom Wheeler turned out to be a friend of the internet and passed new net-neutrality laws that would ensure the freedom of the internet. So he is in fact not a "Dingo" as John Oliver suggested in the link above.
</p>
<p> 
Net Neutrality is a very important issue.  We are all on the internet in one way or another every single day.  We use the internet for leisure, business, etc. Needless to say, it's a HUGE part of our lives. Net-Neutrality as an issue has almost silently come and gone unbeknownst to everyone... and this even includes people in my generation (millenials) who are generally on top of most things tech.
</p>
<p> 
Some may look at the new net-neutrality rules as putting unnecessary regulations on telecoms. Personally, I don't buy it. These new rules set the bar higher for ISP's and let's face it the bar was pretty low for them already. I can't recall anyone having rave reviews about their internet provider's customer service. I don't recall anyone having trouble from choosing their ISP from many options. Most people don't have an option or if they do it's between 2-4 providers max. 
</p>
<p>
The underlying issue is what lobbying does to American politics (but that's an issue in itself).  Allowing ISP's to create local monopolies has eliminated all incentive to deliver their absolute product to market. Not only that but services like Netflix, Hulu, etc pose a legitimate threat to traditional television so of course it's in their best interest to block Net Neutrality. 
</p>
<p>
That to me is the final nail in the coffin. Not only are our internet speeds slow compared to the rest of the world but our ISP's are consistently coming in last place for customer-service. So remind me again why I should feel bad for cable television going out of style? I shouldn't, you shouldn't no one should. At this point it's best for us to be vigilant and fight for your internet rights. If your neighborhoods internet speeds are being throttled and you can prove it... you should go straight to the news about it. The laws have been made and it's up to all of us to hold our internet providers accountable. It's your internet, you're paying for it, don't settle.
