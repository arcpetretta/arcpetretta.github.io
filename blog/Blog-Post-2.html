  <p>
      So this week I started my first week at Dev Bootcamp and I figure now is a good time to reflect on my experiences over the past 5 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, I have been having a good deal of fun learning the things I have.  This week it has been mostly about getting used to the tools I'll be using throughout DBC. Using git took a little getting used to but I feel like I have a pretty good handle on it now.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on what I've read and experienced so far I think I'm going to fit in quite well at DBC. I think the environment invites a lot of people to be introspective which I think is positiive.  
    </p>
    <p>
        During the fireside chat video I watched there was a question that was asked, "Is the environment competitive at DBC?" To which Shereef answers, "There is sometimes friendly competition that drives people to be better but no 'chopping off heads to make yourself taller'."
    </p>
    <p>
        I think this is what made me want to get into software development/engineering. I've always been a teamplayer and would like to work in an environment where people try to help eachother out. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        I'm excited to get into the "meat" of the bootcamp in NYC but also a little nervous at the same time.  I know that the curriculum is rigorous and will definitely challenge someone like me who is a novice at coding. But, I look forward to the challenge and being surrounded by people who are as excited as I am about having this opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's the end of my post for this week! I'll see you all around the same time next week! Peace.
    </p>
