  Arrays and Hashes are unique from eachother.  At their core they are different kinds of data structures that are used to store information.
</p>
<p> 
  An array specifically is an ordered list of items. ex: array = [Lions,Tigers, Bears].  Arrays can call on indexed items by using integer values (numbers). The beauty of this is that arrays allow us to store multiple pieces of information in one variable rather than placing them in several independent variables. When performing a search in an array, your computer will move methodically through each element one by one. Depending on the situation it may be very appropriate to keep and store data in this manner.
</p>
<p>
  The way I see it, it's perfectly appropriate to store data in an array so as long as you can remember the order of the elements and the overall content stored in the array. If not then it may not be the best data structure to use.
</p>
<p>
  The other data structure I've learned about this week is hash.  Hashes are similar to arrays in the sense that they are another type of data structure but that is where the comparison stops.
</p>
<p>
  "A hash is a data structure that stores items by associated keys." In essence, a hash will allow us to store data with an associated keyword which can be very useful if you would like to categorize your data.
</p>
<p> In the end both data structures are useful but it's important to consider when it's most appropriate to do so. If you can easily categorize your data then it may best best to use a hash. If the order in which your data is presented is important then use an array. Use the right tool (datastructure) for the job!
