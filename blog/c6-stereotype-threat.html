<!-- In your post, discuss what stereotype threat is and consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your own personal experiences, try to think of situations that may trigger stereotype threat outside of the examples you researched.

Consider how affected your achievement or how it could impact someone else's achievement (if you are not sharing personal experiences)?

If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

Go into as much depth as feels comfortable for you. Again, if you're not comfortable sharing your own experiences, please apply what you've learned by coming up with some situations where others might feel it.

If you would prefer to answer different questions entirely, please feel free to do so within the context of stereotype threat. -->
<p>
Stereotype threat describes the situation in which people feel that they could be potentially stereotyped / "confirm a negative stereotype about their social group."
</p>
<p>
I've been fortunate enough that I've never really been subjected to negative stereotypes. I can only think of one specific instance where I was stereotyped but it pales in comparison to what some people have to deal with all their lives. With that said, I can remember the emotions I felt in that moment. At first I was surprised and kind of taken back that someone could say what they did.  I thought it was a joke at first and then when I realized that this particular individual was being serious I felt so angry. I ended up just leaving that situation and rarely spoke to that person after that conversation.
</p>
<p>
It wasn't until the next day that I was able to reflect on what happened with a clear head. I couldn't believe how mad I got over what was ultimately a stupid stereotype that I know to be untrue.  But wow, I can totally see how people could get violent or alter their behavior in general as a result of negative stereotypes / discrimination. I mean for me I get mad because of stereotypes attached to my identity but that's about it. People of color and gay/trans people get it way worse... I those people are literally dying because of some of the stereotypes attached to them and it's apalling.
</p>
<p>
Stereotypes as a whole are awkward to deal with. I think the best thing to do is address them when they come up.  There have been times where I've had to step between a friend and a stranger because said stranger was being racist.  Racism is messed up and that's putting it lightly but for better or worse sometimes it's just better to walk away from the situation.  I know that may seem like the weak thing to do but with the way our society is sometimes it's just prudent to walk away. 
</p>
<p>
That's pretty much the extent of my experiences.  I've been luckier than most and that's a blessing in itself. "Lucky" probably isn't the right word... There is inherent privilege that I have because of my skin color in this country. I'm not proud of it but it's outside of my control. All I can do is try to help out those who haven't been as fortunate as myself.
