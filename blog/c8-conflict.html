<div class = "blog-body">
<p>
I can't think of many specific conflicts of the top of my head that were particularly bad but I can easily recall what I think was one of the worst weeks of my life. 
</p>
<p>
I remember when I first went to college I learned of the President's Society.  Being a member of the President's Society is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a student at St. John's. There were around 2,500 or 3,000 kids in my graduating class.  Only 20 students are permitted to become members of the President's Society. Needless to say, as an incoming freshman I was motivated to be one and told my father that when I graduated that I'd have the honor.  He was pretty surprised since I was a very mediocre student in HS.  But college was a new slate and I was motivated.
</p>
<p>
So here comes my junior year... I apply to get into the President's Society and I feel like I have the resume to get in.  I had a 3.7 GPA as an economics major which is notoriously difficult at SJU.  I founded a fraternity on campus and served on its executive board as treasurer until I graduated. I also was the chairman of research and development for our student government in which I conducted research on behalf of the students in order to influence the administration to change rules/policy, etc. On top of this I had exemplified SJU's motto of service through the many hours of community service I performed.
</p>
<p>
Long story short I ended up making it to the final 30 kids. So I made it to the last 30 but couldn't make the final 20.  It was pretty disappointing since I felt I was pretty deserving but that's how life goes sometimes. I eventually came to terms with it and to be honest knowing that I made it that far was a milestone in itself considering that I'm a first generation Italian-American who wasn't a model student in high school. 
</p>
<p>
So this was the start to my week. I missed out on one of my biggest college goals in a pretty gut-wrenching way. If my final President's Society interview was Friday I got the bad news on Monday morning by phone.  Not even an hour after having received that call I got a phone call from my father.  My grandfather for whom I'm named after passed away.  We were so incredibly close and this really made me upset since he was in Italy and I wouldn't even be able to attend the funeral. That afternoon was the big debate for student government in which my ticket would debate the other in order to gain the favor of the student body.  It ended up that the president of our ticket had a lot of skeletons in the closet we didn't know about. I ended up not getting elected treasurer. Voting had not be conducted yet but I just knew in my gut that we lost.
</p>
<p>
So that was pretty much the worst week of my life.  Although I spoke at length about the President's Society please know that the worst part of that week was losing my grandfather by far (and it's not even close). I ended up getting over missing out on PS and student government e-board but it did take time.  Lucky for me I have a lot of good friends who really spent a lot of time with me during that time. That's my preferred way of dealing with stress and conflict.  I think if you can surround yourself with good people that it will help you more than you can imagine.
</p>
<p>
This whole sequence in my life wasn't necessarily a conflict but rather a pretty nasty streak of bad luck.  With time I got over the passing of my grandfather but not getting into e-board or PS really messed with me for a while.  I had a lot of thought about "what if I did this or that." But I eventually realized that it was unhealthy.  There was nothing that I could do at that point to change the outcome of those events so to dwell on it was only going to give me additional stress. To be honest, I didn't have anything to be ashamed of.  The fact that I was in position to be in the PS was an achievement in itself. Being respected enough to be wanted by all tickets involved in the student government election was an affirmation of the influence I had there in one short year.  I realized that I had accomplished a lot up to that point.
</p>
<p>
I learned to cherish what I had instead of the things that managed to escape me. I learned to appreciate that I was fortunate to get a college education to begin with.  That and I really learned that I had a lot of good and genuine friends at school.  There's almost always a silver lining to even the darkest of storm-clouds.
