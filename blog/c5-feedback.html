<p>
Pairing has been a key part of my education during Dev Bootcamp. At first I was kind of skeptical about it but now I've come to appreciate it for a multitude of reasons.  For one, it gives me an opportunity to try and effectively communicate technical concepts to a peer which will be a key skill to have throughout my career as a developer. On top of that, it gives me a chance to see what else my peers have picked up along the way.  There have been a few times where someone has shown me an enumerable that I was not aware of during a pairing session.
</p>
<p>
Pairing for the most part hasn't been frustrating or difficult. However, when it has been it's usually a function of not being able to speak to eachother face to face. That's hardly an issue though... I just prefer to speak to people face to face rather than through a computer screen.
</p>

<p>
The other part of Bootcamp that has been emhpasized has been giving and receiving feedback. It's actually pretty cool because not only are we reading our own feedback but we're also having ours rated by our peers. I've generally had pretty good feedback however I think the most accurate criticism of me is that I can sometimes become a little flustered/frustrated when I don't understand something.  But, I don't project my frustrations on my partner / other people in general (at least I don't think I do!).
</p>
<p>
Writing feedback has been pretty fun.  But I think we won't see eachother's true character until we're on-site and under greater stress. I think then we'll reveal the edgier sides of ourselves along with the pleasant sides we've already shown eachother. Writing feedback has been pretty easy. I try to be as honest as possible without being abrasive.  I hope others will do the same for me. I think that honesty can sometimes hurt but it's all for the better in the end.
</p>
<p>
Pairing has been fun and my feedback has given me things to improve upon.  I look forward to both as we move into the future.
