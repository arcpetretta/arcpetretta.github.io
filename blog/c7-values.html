<div class = "blog-body">
<p>
During my life I've tried to stay true to these values and traits:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activism</li>
  <li>Cooleness Under Fire</li>
  <li>Efficiency</li>
  <li>Helping Others</li>
  <li>Economic Security</li>
  <li>Free Time</li>
</ul>
<p>
In general, I try to live up to these values:
</br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- [ 4 ] ----- 5 Agree
</br>
</p>
<p>
If I had to pick one of these values that I thought was most important to me I think it would have to be "Coolness Under Pressure."  I feel like this is such an underrated trait to have. I think the reason this resonates with me so much is because I remember reading a book by Lee Iacocca years ago about leadership. In the book he discusses the different "C's" of leadership and mentions that the biggest one is "Crisis." He goes on to say how that it's in times of crisis that we show our true character.  I've always felt that being cool under pressure is what seperates the men from the boys.  The ability to react with your head and not your heart in some situations will come in handy more often than you realize.
</p>
<p>
The last topic that someone asked me for advice about was relationship advice funnily enough... I don't think that has anything to do with the values I listed above.  I suppose that you could make the stretch and say it's related to free time but I feel like that's kind of a stretch.
</p>
<p>
I feel pretty proud when I think about my values.  I think these are all traits/things that will help me feel good about myself should I be able to exemplify them in my daily life.  I don't know if it can help me mediate stereotype threat since I'm not sure that I feel that threat often. But I'm sure that being cool under pressure would allow me to realize the situation as it develops and react accordingly.
