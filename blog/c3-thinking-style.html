    According to the Gregorc I'm an abstract/concrete-random thinker. So I guess this means I'm a people-person which is a fair to say about me. I also like to work in groups/individually... It mostly depends on my mood/task at hand. There are plenty of other conclusions we could draw from my thinking profile but for the sake of brevity I'll stop at the aforementioned traits.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think my thinking style will be a strength for me at DBC. I know there is a big emphasis on being good with people and knowing how to work as part of a team. This is something I've done all my life so I think I'll be able to fit in quickly. I think the most common people say about me is that I'm fun to work with.  I don't take life too seriously and am pretty spontaneous which can break up the monotony of the usual work week. On the other side of the coin, some people say that I'm not serious enough about my work and wish I would be more serious... Which is fair criticism but if I can make 4 people happy for every 1 I upset... That's a price I'm willing to pay. I can't possibly please everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phase 0 up until this point has been a fairly pleasant experience.  I get worried that slower work-style may end up hurting me in what will be a fast paced curriculum on site.  But I won't know if my worries are legitimate until I actually set foot in NYC. I also like to ask my peers questions to see what I can learn from them.  I hope that I don't end up bothering people. I just think that we can all learn a lot from eachother.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to a fixed / growth mindset I think that I mostly have a growth mindset.  But I'll be completely honsest that I'll give into a fixed mindset during the periods of self-doubt I have.  There are moments when I struggle with concepts and question whether or not I belong here. I usually come out of it pretty quickly.
  </p>
  <p> 
    I've definitely been a growth mindset type of person for a while now.  I think a lot of it has to do with your personal confidence.  If you're told your whole life that you are what you are and that's it then it's easy to succumb to a fixed mindset.  For me I really started to buy into the idea that hard-work trumps talent while in college and that changed me for the better.
