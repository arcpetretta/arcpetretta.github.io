    Asking good questions is a critical aspect of learning that is often overlooked in our learning experience.  Often we are called upon to regurgitate information that is given to us without thinking critically about it. Since we are conditioned to be this way we often fall short in our ability to ask good, meaningful and targeted questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We ask questions all the time. In fact we probably do it more than you realize.  Everyday most of us use google for one thing or another. Perhaps we're not asking traditional questions but we are using a search engine to retrieve information that we seek.  Effectively using search engines is a very underrated skill but I digress.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post I've been asked to discuss what makes a good question.  Well for one, there is no such thing as "the perfect question." People are smart (often too smart for our own good) we all react differently to external stimuli and likewise we interpret information differently...because of this I believe there are no perfect questions (we can only seek to make them as perfect as possible). With that said I do think good questions have several common traits.  Good questions are concise, specific and provide only the necessary information to receive an answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm still learning how to ask effective questions as it pertains to coding. It's still a subject matter that I still am very new to.  With that said I think when it comes to asking questions about code it's even more so important to be specific about your question. For example, if you have a problem with a loop within your program, make sure to only post the relevant code online. We've all been there before when taking tests: You get asked this wordy question which at first comes off as difficult but you then realize it's actually simple when you understand what the you're actually being asked. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Bearing this in mind, grammar is very important when posting your questions on the web.  When asking questions in person it's very simple to rephrase something that may be confusing to someone else.  On the web it's a little more difficult.  It may take a while for someone to get back to you with a solution but if you can ask your question the right way the first time around you can probably spare yourself the headache of having to rephrase and asking the same question in a different way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be specific, make sure to mind your p's and q's and trim the unecessary info from your questions.  You'll make it easier for people to help you.  Post the relevant code and make sure that you can allow others to recreate error messages that you're getting. It takes practice but if you learn how to do this you'll make your life 100x easier, I guarantee it.
