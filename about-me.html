    Hello everyone!  I figure since this is my personal website that it probably would make most sense to tell you a little bit about who I am.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, I'm Arcangelo Petretta and I like long walks on the beach. Not really, but long walks on the beach are nice. I'm interested in a lot of different things but for the most part my bigger interests are sports and technology. I'm a huge NY sports fan (Knicks, Giants, Yankees, Rangers). I'm an especially big Knicks fan which is somewhat ironic since most of the other teams I'm a fan of are known for their success over the years.  I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something else about me that I think is pretty unique is that I'm a first generation Italian-American (my parents are both "off the boat").  This would be fairly common if it were 1915 but it's pretty uncommon today 100 years later. I hold Italian citizenship as well as American citizenship which I think is pretty cool.  My Uncle owns a pizzeria and my father owns a winery (I've been making wine with my dad since I was 5). I don't think it gets much more Italian than that. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The most recent chapter of my life that I completed was college. <a href = "https://youtu.be/iOKMWSR2Aio?t=2m11s">"I'm DMC in the place to be I went to St. John's University in Queens, NY."</a> Yes, I did go to St. John's and I loved every minute of it. While I was there I majored in Economics in the Peter J. Tobin College of Business. I re-founded a fraternity (was treasurer for two years)there, was part of student government and managed to graduate with honors. I don't say this to gloat or "toot my own horn" but it's something that I'm proud of especially since my parents didn't get the opportunity to go to college. I graduated this past May and hope that I'll have some time to visit Queens and see some friends who are still attending school there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a quirky person in general.  But I will say that my biggest quirk is probably that I'm a winemaker.  I have yet to meet someone my age who makes wine like I do.  It's something that my family has been doing since 1525 (at least that's earliest record of our wine by the Italian government).  So that' always been a big part of my life.  I wish I could be with my dad for the harvest/crush this October since I know how much work that can be but I have a feeling that I won't be able to. I guess I'll just have to settle for drinking it with new friends in NYC.  My favorite grape is Petite Syrah (if you were wondering)! 
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, that's me in a nutshell. Cheers!
