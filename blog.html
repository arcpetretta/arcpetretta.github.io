<p>Technical Blog Post 1</p>

<p>Learning Competencies</p>

<p>7/30/2015</p>

<p>So this will be my first blog post during Dev Bootcamp that will cover some of the techinical concepts I've been learning recently. I'm new so don't judge me! Well even if you do I won't pay it much mind. I'm on my grind and am excited to be moving in the direction that I am.</p>

<p>The first thing I've been asked to do is describe version control. I'm not sure who will be reading this so with that in mind I'll try to describe things in layman's terms... With that said, I guess the best way to think about version control is to compare it to video games. In fact, let's compare it to Pokemon on the gameboy.</p> 

<p>In pokemon you are able to catch pokemon (which are essentially real-world animals with elemental powers). One of the core mechanics of pokemon (or most games for that matter) is the save feature which allows us to create checkpoints we can go back to should you lose a pokemon battle. If you didn't save your game it would mean starting all the way from the beginning should the aforementioned circumstances arise. Keeping this in mind most people would opt to save before situations in which you could A) die or B) enter an event you can only do once (catching a legendary pokemon). By doing this we are able to get an unlimited amount of chances to battle gym leaders or try to catch legendary pokemon.</p> 

<p>Version control allows us to do the same with software / code. Chances are that you'll eventually reach a point at where your program, script, etc. is going to break. Version control software like git allows us to save our work along the way. That way should things go south you'll only have to rebuild some of the code and not all of it. Safeguard your work! Use version control to your advantage!</p>

<p>The way git keeps track of your changes is pretty simple. Git will track the files in your working directory in one of two states... tracked or untracked. "Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or stages." In other words, git will keep track of the changes you make to files but won't actually hold the changes until you commit (save) them.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository"> I found this article pretty helpful if my explanation doesn't quite cut it.</a></p>

<p>When people talk about git they often mention github soon after. First and foremost git and github are different things. git is a version control program while github is a cloud like service that allows you to host your code online publicly or privately. There are several advantages to storing code on GitHub. The first thing that comes to mind is that it preserves your work should something happen to your computer. It also allows you to have your code reviewed by others which has great benefits (people out there could probably teach you a thing or two!).</p>
