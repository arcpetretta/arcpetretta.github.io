JavaScript and Ruby are pretty similar in more ways than one.  But I think it's worth discussing how JavaScript Objects and Ruby Hashes are similar.
</p>
<p> 
At their core they're very simpple.  JavaScript Objects store information and so do Ruby hashes.  The only difference is the way they store info is a little bit different (really not much different at all).  If you have been following my blog posts you've seen me discuss Ruby hashes already. Hashes allow information to be stored and called upon much faster than it would be if stored in an array.  This is achieved by using a unique "Key" to call a value associated with said key.
</br>
</br>
Ex: Hash = {key: value}
</br>
</br>
<p>
Conversely, if we look at JavaScript Objects we can the similarities rather quickly. They may look a little bit different but they perform the same job of storing information. The only difference is that JavaScript Objects store their info in properties which end up taking a similar form.
</br>
</br>
Ex: var Object_Name = {
</br>
		  property: info
</br>
	}
</br>
</br>
</p>
<p>
On a quick glance you can see that the core information is stored inside of curly brackets just like the Ruby Object. The only difference is the names for some of the moving parts.  A key would be a property in a JavaScript object and a value would be the info.
</p>
<p>
Also, the way that we access the info from Javascript Objects / Ruby Hashes is a litle different. In JavaScript we use a dot notation that is fairly straight forward: "Name.property".  This notation will allow us to retrieve the information we want. In ruby they use the key name to retrieve the value also housed within the hash: "Hash[:key]". As I said before, they do what are essentially the same jobs the only difference is that they are contained in two separate programming languages.
